Upgrading from older versions
-----------------------------

If you already have previous version of TopSite 2000 installed on your system, 
you have to do following before running crt.cgi:

1. Run sqlgrab.cgi 
2. Check that generated sites.sql file is complete 
3. Run sqldrop.cgi (Note: It will destroy all tables with all top site data!)
4. Run crt.cgi from new Top Site version
5. Run sqlput.cgi to import old database 

Note: this is not warranted that all stats and clicks will be imported 
completely but all membership information will be saved.
