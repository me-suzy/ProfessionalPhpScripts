The Validator ... don't let another random number slip into your 
credit card batch again!

The Validator verifies all 13 and 16 digit Visa Cards, 16 digit MasterCards,
16 digit Novus (Discover) cards, and 15 digit American Express cards.

Notes and Revision Status
_______________________________________________________________________
Rev. 1.02 - 1 July 1996
Eradicated an errant exit command and installed the no_data subroutine.


Rev. 1.01 - 28 June 1996
The Validator verifies card numbers based on the Mod 10 Algorithm.
Kudos to Aries Solis (asolis@hoovers.com) who originally found the
needed data URL for all the cards and to Melvyn Myers  
(homebuilder@peg.apc.org) for posting the original I hacked into a
totally different animal.  As for the unknown original poster of the
parent version ... eternal gratitude.  

The cc_form.html document is essentially the HTML form front-end for
this script.  Please feel free to copy/paste/edit to suit your needs.

The cc_ver.pl script is platform neutral and should run without 
modification on Unix and NT servers alike under either Perl 4.036 or
5.001m.  Executable file location modifications may be needed, just 
like any other script.  

Please feel free to copy out the needed sections and impliment the 
validation part into your own scripts, all I ask is that proper credit
be retained and noted in your script.

This has been fully debugged and has validated 50 different cards properly.
It has ruthlessly weeded out fabricated Card Numbers.  Basically.. it works
just fine.  If you have any problems, then it resides in how your system is
configured and how you've modified the script.  (read that as "Not My 
Problem")

WARNING: This product warps space and time in its vicinity. 

WARNING: This product attracts every other piece of matter in the universe, 
including the products of other manufacturers, with a force proportional to 
the product of the masses and inversely proportional to the distance between 
them.
 
CAUTION: The mass of this product contains the energy equivalent of 85 million
tons of TNT per net ounce of weight.
 
HANDLE WITH EXTREME CARE: This product contains minute electrically charged 
particles moving at velocities in excess of five hundred million miles per hour.
 
CONSUMER NOTICE: Because of the "uncertainty principle," it is impossible for 
the consumer to find out at the same time both precisely where this product is
and how fast it is moving.
 
ADVISORY: There is an extremely small but nonzero chance that, through a 
process known as "tunneling," this product may spontaneously disappear from 
its present location and reappear at any random place in the universe, 
including your neighbor's domicile. The manufacturer will not be responsible 
for any damages or inconveniences that may result.
 
READ THIS BEFORE OPENING PACKAGE: According to certain suggested versions 
of the Grand Unified Theory, the primary particles constituting this product 
may decay to nothingness within the next four hundred million years.
 
THIS IS A 100% MATTER PRODUCT: In the unlikely event that this merchandise 
should contact antimatter in any form, a catastrophic explosion will result.
 
PUBLIC NOTICE AS REQUIRED BY LAW: Any use of this product, in any manner 
whatsoever, will increase the amount of disorder in the universe. Although 
no liability is implied herein, the consumer is warned that this process will 
ultimately lead to the heat death of the universe.
 
NOTE: The most fundamental particles in this product are held together by 
a "gluing" force about which little is currently known and whose adhesive 
power can therefore not be permanently guaranteed.
 
ATTENTION: Despite any other listing of product contents found hereon, the 
consumer is advised that, in actuality, this product consists of 
99.9999999999% empty space.
 
NEW GRAND UNIFIED THEORY DISCLAIMER: The manufacturer may technically be 
entitled to claim that this product is ten-dimensional. However, the consumer 
is reminded that this confers no legal rights above and beyond those 
applicable to three-dimensional objects, since the seven new dimensions 
are "rolled up" into such a small "area" that they cannot be detected.
 
PLEASE NOTE: Some quantum physics theories suggest that when the consumer 
is not directly observing this product, it may cease to exist or will exist 
only in a vague and undetermined state.
 
COMPONENT EQUIVALENCY NOTICE: The subatomic particles (electrons, protons, etc.) 
comprising this product are exactly the same in every measurable respect as 
those used in the products of other manufacturers, and no claim to the contrary 
may legitimately be expressed or implied.
 
HEALTH WARNING: Care should be taken when lifting this product, since its 
mass, and thus its weight, is dependent on its velocity relative to the user.
 
IMPORTANT NOTICE TO PURCHASERS: The entire physical universe, including this 
product, may one day collapse back into an infinitesimally small space. Should 
another universe subsequently re-emerge, the existence of this product in 
that universe cannot be guaranteed.       


Luv ya'll - Enjoy!
