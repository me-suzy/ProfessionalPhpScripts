    <P><CENTER>ES Doctor will go through your database file by file
    and make sure that everything is healthy. It will print any errors
    that occur.</CENTER></P>

    <P><CENTER>This program does the following:<BR>
    - Opens your aU.dat (your main user list)<BR>
    - Swings through all the user files and makes sure they have
    an entry for the IN hits, OUT hits, and Return URL.</CENTER></P>

    run it):</CENTER></P>

    <UL>
      <LI><CENTER><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">All done - Total Number of
      uses = # Number of healthy users = #</FONT><BR>
      If this is the only response you get back, then everything is
      perfect with your database (from the doctors view).</CENTER>
      <LI><CENTER><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">Error opening up aU.dat </FONT>-
      This is the worst one you can get because it means that your
      user list isn't functional. You need to go replace the aU.dat
      from your backup. Go to the &quot;use backup&quot; and click
      on the &quot;user entire database&quot;. Then run the doctor
      again. You may have to go into your es/data directory and actually
      delete the users files that don't belong.</CENTER>
      <LI><CENTER><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">Error- user file (user) is
      unable to be opened. Please check it.</FONT> - This means that
      your user list has an entry in it that shouldn't be there or
      is unreachable. Just go delete that user using the &quot;delete&quot;
      program and readd them...you may get an error trying to delete
      them but it is ok.</CENTER>
      <LI><CENTER><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">It appears user file (user)
      is empty. Delete and readd this user</FONT> - This means the
      stat file for that particular user is empty. You will need to
      go and delete it using the &quot;delete&quot; progran and readd
      it with the &quot;add partner&quot;. Or you could use the backup
      copy and try using the backup copy for that user. Go to &quot;back
      up&quot; and add the user in the bottom field, NOT the entire
      backup, just the single user.</CENTER>
      <LI><CENTER><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">User file (user) is missing
      either an IN hits stat, an OUT hits stat, or a return url. Delete
      and readd this user</FONT> - This means that the user file is
      corrupted. Either they don't have an IN hit, OUT hit, or URL
      stat. Just go either delete and readd or use the backup copy
      as mentioned above.</CENTER>
