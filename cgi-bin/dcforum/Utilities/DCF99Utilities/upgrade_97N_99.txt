UPGRADING TO DCFORUM99 AND DCFORUMLITE FROM DCFORUM97N
DO NOT USE THIS SCRIPT IF YOU OWN DCFORUM97
=================================================================

Originally, the threads in
were simply HTML files.  With DCF99,
we decided to store each thread as a text-delimited database.
Instead of dynamically generating each thread, however, an HTML thread
would be created each time this text file is modified.  So, while
the navigation experience is the same, the forum data is portable.

In doing so, you must convert all your HTML threads to these data files,
and then recreate those threads by running UPDATE THREADS from your
DCAdmin.  The script that will help you migrate is conv_97N_99.cgi

NOTE: THIS CONVERSION WILL ONLY WORK IF YOU DID NOT MODIFY OR CUSTOMIZE
THE THREAD LAYOUT-THAT IS, YOU DIDN'T MODIFY ANY PORTIONS OF
dcboard.cgi's html_main_output and create_message.
THIS DOES NOT INCLUDE CUSTOMIZATION YOU MAY HAVE MADE TO html_template.pl.
IF YOU DID MODIFY ANY ONE OF THE ABOVE FUNCTIONS OR YOU'RE NOT SURE,
PLEASE CONTACT dc@dcscripts.com with subject heading "97N to 99 Help".

PLEASE FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTION AS STATED.  DO NOT SKIP A STEP

UPGRADE PROCEDURE
=================================================================
1. Backup
2. Convert Data format by running conv_97N_99.cgi
3. Install DCForum99

I. BACKING UP EXISTING FILES
=================================================================

1) Let your site users be aware that the forum will be down
for an hour or so.

2) Download DCForum97N files from your /cgi-bin/dcforum directory
   to your PC and save it as backup.

3) Delete Sessions and Library directories and all the files in them.

II.  CREATING THREAD DATABASE FILES
=================================================================

The first step of migrating forum DCForum97N to DCF99 Ver 1.1
is to create thread database from your existing HTML files.
This is done by running conv_97N_99.cgi.  Doing so, it will create
forum_info.txt, conf_info.txt, and *.txt files in FORUMDIR/Data directories.
It will also create FORUMDIR/EMail directory which is used by DCF99.

1) From DCF99 package, upload cgi-lib.pl, dclib.pl, dcforumlib.pl, 
and dcforumlib2.pl to your cgi-bin/dcforum directory.

2) Edit conv_97N_99.cgi - you need to edit the followin variables:

   $path - directory path to your current dcforum cgi-bin directory

   # If your setup files are named differently, then
   # modify lines below

   require "$path/dcforum97.setup";
   require "$path/dcadmin97.setup";
   require "$path/dcboard97.setup";

3) Upload conv_97N_99.cgi to your server and chmod 755
4) Run conv_97N_99.cgi using your browser.

At this point, you should see output like:

Creating forum_info.txt.....Created forum_info.txt
Creating conf_info.txt.....Created conf_info.txt

If you do not get an output like this or you are not sure, 
PLEASE CONTACT US at support@dcscripts.com.  !!!DO NOT GO ANY FURTHER!!!

5) If you browser output did look OK, then run

conv_97N_99.cgi?doit

6) Delete every file in your cgi-bin/dcforum directory.
   You may want to save html_template.pl (template file) to
   help you customize dcforum.htmlt (the new template file).

   Now you are ready to install DCF 99

III Install DCForum 99
============================================================

1) Follow the instruction in install_nt.txt or install_unix.txt...

   NOTE: Be sure to specify correct path for $maindir - this should be the
   same as how it is defined in your current dcforum setup file.

   NOTE: Be sure to update your image icons...some icons are new

   MAKE SURE YOU REGISTER AS THE ADMIN AND DO NOTHING ELSE.

2) At this point, you should already see conference and forums...also,
   you should be able to navigate from forums to main listings.
   The only thing that need to be changed is the message (topic format).
   This is outlined in setup 4).

3) Before you run update_threads, you may want to edit dcforum.htmlt template file.
   This is just an HTML file so it should be easy to modify.  This file
   replaces your html_template.pl

4) To create topics using the new template, we need to update the threads.
   To do this, log on to dcadmin and run update_threads.


If all goes well, you should be all set!
