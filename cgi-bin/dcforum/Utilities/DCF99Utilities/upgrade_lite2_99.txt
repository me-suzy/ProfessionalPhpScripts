UPGRADING TO DCFORUM99 Ver 1.1 FROM DCFORUMLITE Ver 2.0
=================================================================

Upgrading from DCForumLite Ver 2.0 to DCF99 Ver 1.1 is really simple.

1) Remove auth_setup_file.txt and board_setup_file.txt from User_info
2) Create "private_dcforum" directory under your cgi-bin/dcforum folder
3) Change permission of this directory to 777
4) Edit your dcforum.setup (one that you are currently using).  Uncomment
   $privatedir and $privateext.
5) Define $privatedir, the directory location of "private_dcforum" you
   just created
6) Edit all the *.cgi file - you should check the very first line of each script
   to make sure that it points to the correct location of Perl on your server
   Additionally, make sure $path is defined correctly.
7) Upload (In ASCII Mode) *.cgi and *.pl files to your server...the only files
   you don't need to upload is *.setup files

That's it!
