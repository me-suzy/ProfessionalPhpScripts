UPGRADING TO DCFORUM99 Ver. 1.1 FROM DCFORUM99 Ver. 1.000, 1.001, and 1.002
=================================================================

DURING THE UPGRADE, YOU MAY WANT TO ALERT YOUR USERS.
YOU SHOULD TAKE dcboard.cgi OFF LINE WHILE YOUR UPGRADING.

BEFORE YOU BEGIN...
1) Backup all *.txt file in your User_info directory
2) Backup all your script files in your dcforum cgi-bin directory
3) Backup your database.txt in your forum directories

What's new in Ver 1.1?
--------------------------------------------------------
Added Features:
1) Conference - Grouping of Forums.  You have the option to
   only display conferences in the LOBBY or every forum
   grouped in each conference.
2) Printer Friendly Format - Allows the displaying of printer friendly page
3) Optional fully threaded main listing - for that classic BBS look
4) Topic Autosensing - If the number of messages in a given topic
   reaches a maximum number set by the administrator, the script
   kicks into single message mode wherein the user can read one message
   at a time.  There is also 'Display All' mode so that users can still
   display entire topic
5) Option to use classic text threading in the table of contents
6) Added text navigation menu to the top of lobby and main listing

Upgrading from DCForum99 Ver. 1.000 and 1.001
-----------------------------------------------
In order to upgrade to 1.1, you must first update
your database.txt to be 1.002 compatible.  To do this, you simply run
conv_database.cgi (in Utilities folder).  Here's what the script does:

- Replaces "\0" with "|" - caption
  gets its own field in database.txt
  -  Those who are currently using Release 1.000 or 1.001 must
     use this conversion script before installing later patch.

To run conv_database.cgi:
1) If not done yest, backup all database.txt (just in case)
2) Edit first line of conv_database.cgi to properly
   define the location of perl 5 on your server.
3) Edit $path - should be same as your other scripts
4) Upload conv_database.cgi to your dcforum cgi-bin.  This is
   where all your dcforum scripts are.
5) Chmod conv_database.cgi to 755
6) Run conv_database.cgi from your browser.  The URL would be
   http://www.yourdomain.com/cgi-bin/dcforum_path/conv_database.cgi

At this point, your database.txt IS Ver 1.002 compatible.
Next, go on to 'Upgrading from DCForum99 Ver 1.002'


Upgrading to DCForum99 Ver. 1.002
-----------------------------------------------
In order to include conference feature, forum information in forum_info.txt
had to include additional field.  To add this, you must run conv_forum_info.cgi
before you upload rest of the new files.

1) If not done yet, backup *.txt files in your User_info directory.
2) Delete board_setup_file.txt in your User_info_directory
3) Edit your dcforum.setup file (not the new copy but the one on your server)
4) At the very bottom of dcforum.setup, add:

   $conf_file = "conf_info.txt";

   This is where the conference information will be stored.
5) Upload dcforum.setup to your server.
6) Edit first line of conv_forum_info.cgi to properly
   define the location of perl 5 on your server.
7) Edit $path - should be same as your other scripts
8) Upload conv_forum_info.cgi to your dcforum cgi-bin.  This is
   where all your dcforum scripts are.
9) Chmod conv_database.cgi to 755
10) Run conv_forum_info.cgi from your browser.  The URL would be
   http://www.yourdomain.com/cgi-bin/dcforum_path/conv_forum_info.cgi
11) Edit *.cgi files from Ver1.1.  Namely, the first line (#!/usr/bin/perl) and
    the $path statement.  If you're not sure, take a look at your older scripts.
12) Upload the following files to your server and chmod properly:

dcadmin.cgi (755)
dcboard.cgi (755)
dcextra.cgi (755)
dclogin.cgi (755)
dcpost.cgi (755)
dcuser.cgi (755)
help.cgi (755)
dcforumlib.pl
dcforumlib2.pl
global.pl
dcprotect.pl
dclib.pl

DO NOT UPLOAD dcboard.setup, dcforum.htmlt and dcadmin.setup since you already customized it.

13) Start DCAdmin and choose 'Create Conference' and create some conferences.
14) For each forums, select Modify Forums and assign conferences.
