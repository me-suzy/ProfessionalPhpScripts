Advanced Poll v2.02
-------------------

FAQ:

- After voting I get the following error:
  Warning: Cannot add header information - headers already sent by 
  (output started at ...) in ..poll_cookie.php on line ...

Make sure that the page your poll is embedded in has the
<?php require "poll_cookie.php"; ?>
tag before anything else.


- How can I display the result of the last poll?

require "./booth.php";
echo $php_poll->view_poll_result(x);      // x = Poll ID of your last poll
