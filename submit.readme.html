A 500 server error is not enough information to troubleshoot your problem. It basically means that the web server has no idea what went wrong, so it didn't display the page. To see what the problem is, you need to see what the <i>real</i> error message is. There are two ways to find 
the real error message: check the server error logs, or run the script from the 
command line.&nbsp; The location of your server error logs depends on your server configuration.&nbsp; (See "Running SimpleSubmit from the UNIX or DOS command line" below for more information) </font></p>

           When you first run 
the SimpleSubmit setup application, you will be prompted  to run standard setup, advanced 
setup or update the .tab file.&nbsp; It is recommended that you first use standard setup to get the script up and running.&nbsp; Once you have the script working properly, you may want to go back and customize it using advanced setup. Standard setup requires only one configuration variable and installs SimpleSubmit with the options that are most common for personal use.&nbsp; Standard setup installs SimpleSubmit using the "Ban All" security mode, no "thank-you message", no usage logging and maximum of 10 URLs at one time.</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">  If you use SimpleSubmit as a service to other webmasters and/or promote it as your own service, you will need to run advanced setup. You will need to provide more information to get started, however you can run the setup program as many times as you like and your previous settings will be retained. If you should ever wish to restore the default settings, simply run the standard setup.</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">        
           Advanced setup 
lets you choose between the two security modes: "Ban All Domains by Default," 
or "Allow All Domains by Default."&nbsp;To prevent abuse of you server, it is recommended 
that you choose "Ban All" unless you understand what you are doing. "Ban 
All" means that <EM>only </EM>domains which you specify                                             may use SimpleSubmit on your server. This prevents abuse because you have total control over which domains are allowed to submit. "Allow All" mode does the exact opposite. All domains are allowed by default unless you specifically ban them.&nbsp; It is necessary to use "Allow All" if you want to provide SimpleSubmit as a service to other webmasters, since you don't know the domain names of the people who will be using your service.&nbsp; However, "Allow All" opens your site to possible abuse. If you choose this security mode, it is recommended that you also enable logging and monitor the log file regularly.</font></p>

		<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"> The .tab file is a database containing information about the search engines. Since each search engine is owned by a difference company, their methods for submitting sites will vary. Most search engines change this method from time to time. Also, new search engines are added periodically to the database. By maintaining all of this information in a separate database file, SimpleSumbit can be updated easily without reinstalling the script. To see what .tab version you have, you can enter "info" (without the quotes) in the URL field of simplesubmit.</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">To update your .tab file, you can simply run the setup program and select the third option "Update .tab File Only" The setup program will download the latest .tab file from verysimple.com and overwrite your existing .tab file. WARNING: If you have customized your .tab file, please be sure to make a backup copy before updating!</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">You can also add your own search engines to the .tab file. See the Customizing section of this page for more inforamation.</font></p>

		<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><b>Running SimpleSubmit From The Browser</b></font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Using the SimpleSubmit browser interface is easy. Open submit.cgi in your preferred web browser (for example http://www.yoursite.com/cgi-bin/submit.cgi). Enter one or more URL's in the URL field (one per line). Enter your e-mail address in the e-mail field.</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">If you wish to use the default search engines, then you can click submit at this point. If you want to submit only to specific search engines or one that is not a default engine, then you can click on only those engines you wish to submit.</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">If you don't want a thank-you message, then you can unselect that checkbox.</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><b>Running SimpleSubmit From the UNIX or DOS command Line:</b></font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">SimpleSubmit can be run from the command line as well as through a web browser. To do this, you must have Perl installed. (Windows users can download Perl from ActiveState) All of the features of SimpleSubmit are available through the command line, however it is easier to use the browser interface. It may be preferable to use the command line interface, however, especially if you wish to schedule SimpleSubmit to run automatically.</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Usage:</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><i>perl submit.cgi url=http://site.com/ email=me@site.com [confirm=yes] [engines=a,b,c]</i></font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">[brakets] indicate optional fields.  Specify multiple sites and multiple engines by separating them with a comma. If you do not specify command line parameters when you run the script then SimpleSubmit will promt you. Enter 1 parameter per line and press &lt;CTRL&gt; d (for UNIX) or &lt;CTRL&gt; z (for DOS) when finished.</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><b>Scheduling SimpleSubmit to Run Automatically:</b></font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">One possible use of SimpleSubmit is to automatically schedule it to run and submit your site on a regular basis.  (A word of caution: don't schedule your submissions too frequently or the search engines may permanently block your site.  Once per month or less is gererally sufficient)</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">To schedule SimpleSubmit to run on UNIX, you can use the cron utility.  Usage rules vary from host to host, so check with your admin and/or support pages.  To schedule using Windows/DOS, you can use the built-in task scheduler.  Refer to the Microsoft help file for more inforamation.</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">When you schedule SimpleSubmit to run automatically, it is usually helpful to have the normal output go to a file instead of to the screen - since you won't be there to see it.  This can help you troubleshoot and/or see that the last submission went as planned.  The email confirmation is also helpful, as it will email you the results.</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">To send the output to a file, you simply append "&gt; filename" to the command line.  For example:</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">perl submit.cgi url=http://site.com email=me@site.com &gt; /usr/site/submitresult.txt</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><a name="custom"></a></font>

		</p>
		<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><b>Colors and Layout:</b></font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">You can completely customize the look of SimpleSubmit to match your own brand or site design. Two configuration files contain the HTML code that is used by SimpleSubmit. By default, these are <b>submit.hed</b> and <b>submit.fot</b> and they are located in the same directory as submit.cgi. (You can change the name and location of these files using advanced setup).</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">submit.hed contains all the HTML code at the top of the page and submit.fot contains the code at the bottom. submit.cgi automatically generates all of the other code. Although you cannot customize the automatically generated code, you can specify the color of the borders and fonts in advanced setup.</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Edit submit.hed and submit.fot to match the design of your existing site. </font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">NOTE: although it is possible to create a design using tables and put the SimpleSubmit automatically generated text within this table, it is not recommended. The reason for this is that SimpleSubmit will display the search engine results in real-time. If you are submitting to a large number of engines, then it is helpful to see the progress. Putting the results in a table usually will cause the browser to wait until the entire page loads before displaying anything. If you do this, it will appear that SimpleSubmit is not loading, when in fact it is just taking several moments to contact all of the search engines. For this reason, it is recommended that you do not enclose the results in a table. If you need to do this to accomodate your site design, it is recommeded that you use frames instead.</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">If you need to customize the main SimpleSubmit page beyond what is allowed using submit.hed and submit.fot, you can do that as well. Simply open submit.cgi in your browser and save the HTML source. Customize it as much as you like. You can then use this page as the form interface to SimpleSubmit instead of the autmatically generated page. Note, that if you update your .tab file, you may need to edit your custom design to add or remove any search engines from the select box.</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><b>Thank-You Message:</b></font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">In advanced setup you can specify that a thank-you message is sent when people use SimpleSubmit. (Sendmail or SMTP is required to use this feature) The content of this message is generated from a template file, <b>submit.tha</b>. You can edit this file to your liking.</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">You can specify that that thank-you message is sent in Plain Text or HTML format in advanced setup. All e-mail clients can read plain-text. HTML format allows you to create a formatted message with layout and graphics, however not all e-mail clients support HTML e-mail. If you specify HTML format, then you will want to design submit.tha as an HTML document.</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><b>Add Your Own Search Engines:</b></font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">SimpleSubmit can be enhanced by adding your own search 
engines.&nbsp; SimpleSubmit come pre-installed with most of the major search 
engines, but you can add value by customizing it with your own selection of 
search engines.&nbsp; Imagine if you have a sports-related site.&nbsp; You can 
customize SimpleSubmit to submit to all the sports-related search engines on the 
web.&nbsp; There are hundreds of search engines and link pages for all topics.&nbsp; SimpleSubmit will work with the vast majority of them.&nbsp; You can offer highly targeted promotion to your visitors, or simply use SimpleSubmit to make your own promotional efforts easier.&nbsp;</font></p>
<P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular>All the information 
about each search engine is contained in the file submit.tab.&nbsp; This is 
simply a tab-delimited database file containing information about each engine. 
The file can be opened with any text, spreadsheet or database application tat 
supports tab-delimited files (such as MS Excel or MS Access).&nbsp; You can even 
open it using notepad, however it can be tricky to read.</FONT></P>
		<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">The .tab file has several fields that are used to tell SimpleSubmit how each particular engine works. To add a new engine, you simply add a new line to the end of the file and fill in each field with the appropriate information.</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">To add a new engine, you will have to visit the site that you want to add and do a bit of detective work. Find the page that the engine provides for submitting sites. This page will contain a form with several fields and an "action" URL that the form uses to process the form. View the source of this page, submit your site and examine how the engine works.</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Adding new engines might seem complicated at first. By looking at the .tab file, visiting a few of the default search engines and submitting a page directly from their site, you should be able to see how it works. The good news is that most search engines are very similar. Once you add one new engine, it will be easy to add more.</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><b>TabFile Fields:</b></font></p>
		<ul>
			<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><b>Code</b>: This is a unique code you assign to each engine. It is best to use only characters or numbers (no spaces).</font>
			<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><b>Category</b>: Category for each engine. Currently this field is not used, but future support for multiple categories is planned.</font>
			<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><b>Description</b>: A brief description of the seach engine.</font>
			<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><b>HomeUrl</b>: The URL to the search engines home page. Currently this field is not used, but future support is planned. This is also helpful information to have if the submission method changes.</font>
			<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><b>LogoUrl</b>: A URL to a graphic logo for the site. Currently this field is not used, but future support is planned.</font>
			<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><b>SubmitUrl</b>: The URL to the submission processing page. Note, this is not necessarily the page where their submission form is, but the actual program or script that is used to process submissions.</font>
			<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><b>Method</b>: Method is either GET or POST. This refers to the submission method requred by the search engine.</font>
			<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><b>Varmap</b>: Varmap tells SimpleSubmit what the variables names are for this search engine. This tells SimpleSubmit how to send the URL, Email and any other fields to the engine. See below for more details about Varmap.</font>
			<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><b>StaticVars</b>: StaticVars are any variables that the search engine requires to process the submission that are not provided by the webmaster. As an example example, a certain search engine may require "action=submit" for every submission so that the form processor know what to do with the data. You can add as many static variables as necessary.</font>
			<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><b>Success</b>: So that SimpleSubmit knows whether or not the submission succeeded, it parses the results from the search engine and looks for a "Success" message. This is simply any bit of text that appears on the search engines results pages when the submission is successful. For example, a certain engine may display "Thank You" when your submission was accepted. Be sure that the text you specify does not appear if the submission failed, or else SimpleSubmit will always think that the submissions to this engine were successful.</font>
			<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><b>Default</b>: 1 = yes, 0 = no. This specifies whether this search engine is a default when submitting your sites.</font></li>
		</ul>
		<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><b>More About theVarmap Field:</b></font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">                                                  The VarMap field may seem confusing at first, but if you look at the tab file and examine the search engines, you'll see that it is actually not that complicated.</font></p>
<P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular>SimpleSubmit 
essentially allows you to forward the information in one HTML form to multiple 
search engines. However, each of those engines has a different system for 
accepting input. For example, Altavista expects the URL field to be called "q", 
while Excite expects a field called "url." SimpleSubmit needs to know how to 
send your information to each unique engine. To do that, the Varmap field is 
used to map the fieldname on the SimpleSubmit HTML form to the fieldname used by 
the search engine.</FONT></P>
		<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"> On the SimpleSubmit HTML form, the URL field is called 
"url" and the email field is called "email." To add a new engine, we simply need 
to know how these two fields <EM>map </EM>     to the 
new search engine. For example, say we add an engine that expects a field "p" to contain the 
URL and a field "e" to contain the email address. In this case, the 
Varmapforthisenginewouldbe"url=p,email=                                           e"&nbsp; Say we add an another engine that expects a field "site" to contain the URL and a field "contact" to contain the email address. In this case, theVarmapforthisenginewouldbe"url=site,email=contact"&nbsp;</font></p>

		<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">              If you want to add an engine that requires more fields than just URL and Email, then you can simply add those to the Varmap field as well. However, you will have to create a custom SimpleSubmit form to use as well. For example, say you want to add an engine thatexpectsURL,EmailandSiteTitle.TheVarmapmightlooksomethinglikethis"url=p,email=e,title=t." After you add the engine to the .tab file, you'll have to create a form that has a field for the title in addition to the regular SimpleSubmit fields.</font></p>
