<h2><a name="3">3.&nbsp; Setting up conferences and forums</a></h2>
Once forum options are set, the next step in creating
discussion forum is to create conferences and forums.
There are couple of things that you should think about
before you start creating them.

<ul>
<li><b>Should you setup multiple conferences?</b>
	A conference is a group of forums belonging to a similar topic.
	Whether you need multiple conferences or not will depend on how many
	forums you will be setting up.  If you are going to setup
	over 10 forums, then it is a good idea to break those forums
	up into two or more conferences.  On the other hand,
   if you are only going to set up 5 or 6 forums then you would only
	need to create a single conference.  In this case, you can create a
	conference named 'Main' and assign all your forums to this
	conference.
<li><b>What type of forums will you need?</b>
	DCForum supports three types of forums: Public, Protected, and Private.
	The difference between these forum types is the user accessibility.  
	If you want to allow everyone to
   participate without registering, then choose Public forums.  
	If you want to allow
   everyone to read but require registration to 
	post messages, then choose Protected
   forum.  Private forums are highly exclusive in that,
	 the users must be elevated to
   'member' user group in order to qualify to use them.  
	Additionally, the moderator
   of that forum must grant access to his/her private forums.
<li><b>Will you need moderated forums?</b> Moderated forums allow you to preview the messages before they 
    are posted in the forums. It works with all three forum types. Whether you 
    need this level of security will depend on your needs.</li>            
                
            
</ul>

<h3>Creating A Conference</h3>
<ol>
<li> From DCAdmin menu, choose &quot;Create New Conference&quot;.
<li> Enter conference name.
<li> Enter conference description.
<li> Select conference status. If &quot;off&quot;, all the forums
     belonging to this conference will not display
	  in the lobby.
<li>Click on &quot;Submit&quot; button.</li>       
</ol>

<p>
<b>Note:</b> If you have conferences that contain no
forums, then they will not appear in the conference listings.
</p>

After you've created all the conferences, we next need to create forums.

<h3>Creating A Forum</h3>
<ol>
<li> From DCAdmin menu, choose &quot;Create New Forum&quot;.
<li> Select a conference - this conference is where
     this new forum will belong.
<li> Enter forum name.
<li> Enter forum description.
<li> Select forum moderator(s).
<li> Select forum type.
<li> Select form mode.
<li> Select forum status. If &quot;Not Active&quot;, this forum
     will not
<li> Click on &quot;Submit&quot; button.</li>        
</ol>

<p>
Congratulations!  You have now setup DCForum for your
web site.  Now, let's customize your forum layout.
</p>

<h3><a name="custom">Customizing Forum Layout</a></h3>
DCForum program uses a single template file to generate
all it's output.  This template file, dcforum.htmlt, is simply an HTML file
with special tags that are used by the program to
generate the output.  Hence, editing this one file can change the whole
look of your discussion forum.  In addition, DCF2000 allows you to
use different template files for each forum.


<p><b>Modifying dcforum.htmlt
</b></p>

<ol>
<li> From your /cgi-bin/dcforum directory,
     download dcforum.htmlt file to your local PC
	  or workstation. Please remember to use ASCII mode
     of file transfer when you FTP this file.
<li> Open dcforum.htmlt in your favorite, plain text editor.
     For example, use notepad or homesite (http://www.homesite.com).
<li> Modify dcforum.htmlt as you like.  Just remember not to remove
     the following DCF tags:
	  <ul>
	  <li>$TITLE
	  <li>$HTTPHEADER
	  <li>$HEADING
	  <li>$SUBHEADING
	  <li>$HTTPHEADER
	  <li>$MENU
	  <li>$HTMLOUTPUT
	  <li>$FORUMLINKS</li>
	  </ul>
<li> Edit email link on the bottom of the template file.
<li>Save and upload this file to /cgi-bin/dcforum 
    directory.</li>        
          
</ol>

Note that if you want to display a banner on every page, you can
include the banner tag in this template file.

<p><b>Multiple template file
</b></p>

You can specify different template file for each
forum simply by creating different dcforum.htmlt file
and then uploading it to /htdocs/dcforum/forum directory.

<ol>
<li> Edit dcforum.htmlt template file as directed
     in &quot;Modifying dcforum.htmlt&quot; section.
<li>Instead of uploading dcforum.htmlt to the 
    /cgi-bin/dcforum directory, upload it to /htdocs/dcforum/forum_name where 
    forum_name is the directory name of the forum in question.</li>       
         
                 
         
	      
	        
</ol>
